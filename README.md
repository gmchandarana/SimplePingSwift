# SimplePingSwift

SimplePingSwift is a Swift framework for performing network ping operations. It provides an easy-to-use interface to ping single or multiple hosts and handles responses efficiently. The framework internally uses the [SimplePing]([https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/SimplePing/Introduction/Intro.html]) Objective-C class for low-level ping operations.

## Features

- Ping single or multiple hosts
- Receive detailed ping results
- Configure ping settings such as the number of attempts, interval between attempts, and timeout
- Delegate methods for handling ping events

## Installation
For now, you can use it as a framework. I'm in the process of making it available via SPM and Cocoapods.
